# Scam Detector

(UPDATE IN README.md)
Briefly describe the purpose/result(s) of your project, the skills you applied, and the AI4ALL Ignite program.

*EXAMPLE:*
*Developed a scam detector for SMS messages that automatically identifies whether a given message is ham/normal, spam, or smishing through employing 3 different supervised machine learning models, which are Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Linear Regression models.*

## Problem Statement <!--- do not change this line -->

(UPDATE IN README.md)
Describe the motivation for this project, why it is relevant, and what its impacts are.

*EXAMPLE:*
*As technology continues to evolve, it’s becoming increasingly difficult for older generations and those with limited exposure to technology to identify scam messages. At the same time, scammers are taking advantage of digital platforms to commit fraud more easily. One major concern is the rise in scam messages, which has grown significantly. To address this issue, we’ve decided to build a model that can detect and flag scam messages automatically.*

## Key Results <!--- do not change this line -->

(UPDATE IN README.md)
Enumerate the main results of this project in a list and describe them.

*EXAMPLE:*
1. *Recorded over 1,000 unique prompts and their responses generated by ChatGPT*
2. *Identified three biases in ChatGPT's responses*
   - *When prompted about this world event*
   - *When prompted about this field of science*
   - *When prompted about this political party*


## Methodologies <!--- do not change this line -->

(UPDATE IN README.md)

*EXAMPLE:*
*To accomplish this, we utilized the OpenAI API to interact with ChatGPT, and we designed a custom Python script to generate diverse prompts and collect corresponding responses. The data was then processed and analyzed using pandas, enabling us to detect patterns and biases in the AI model's outputs.*
*Engineered a Python script to generate over 1,000 prompts and elicit their responses from ChatGPT, utilizing pandas to collect the data. When prompted for solutions to this specific relevant crisis, nearly 80% of ChatGPT's responses promoted a certain worldview.*


## Data Sources <!--- do not change this line -->

(UPDATE IN README.md)
Include any relevant data sources that were used in your project.

*EXAMPLE:*
*Kaggle Datasets: [Link to Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)*
